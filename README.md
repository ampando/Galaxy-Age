# Space Age Calculator

#### Independent Project for Epicodus
#### Adrienne Matosich 05.19.2022

## An application that allows a user to calculate their age in various planetary years. Designed to show my ability with using Jest and test-driven development, red/green/refactor workflow, npm and a Webpack environment. 


### Specs
1. Create a class constructor for a user that includes properties of userAge, userLifeExpectancy and planetYearsInEarthYears.
- Input: N/A
- Output: class SpaceAge {
  constructor(userAge, userLifeExpectancy, planetYearsInEarthYears) {
  this.userAge = userAge;
  this.userLifeExpectancy = userLifeExpectancy;
  this.planetYearsInEarthYears = planetYearsInEarthYears;

2. Create a function prototype that calculates that user's age on the selected planet.
- Input: userEarthAge: 42 years
- Output: mercuryAge: 175 years

3. Create a function prototype that calculates the user's life expectancy on the selected planet.
- Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100 years
- Output: mercuryLifeExpectancy: 417 years

4. Create a function prototype that calculates how many years you have left to live on the selected planet given your life expectancy.
- Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100, userAge: 42
- Output: yearsLeft: 58/.24 = 242 years left 

5. Create a function prototype that will calculate if userEarthAge is greater than userLifeExpectancy and then return the difference in the selected planet years.
- Input: userEarthAge: 101, userLifeExpectancy: 100
- Output: userEarthAge - userLifeExpectancy / .24 = 4 mercuryYears beyond life expectancy
